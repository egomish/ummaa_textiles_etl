One end is a long, hollow tube, made of 1 piece of leather sewed together with fiber.  The other end is a rectangular pouch with one end left open and slightly rounded.  Arrow shafts insert into the tube end and points into the pouch end.  It is set up so that the shaft has to go in first, and only then can the point be pushed into the pouch.  This method keeps the arrows in the quiver.  A leather strap is attached to each part, and they are stitched together with cotton string.  The straps are attached to the tube and pouch with fiber cord.  Fiber string is also used to sew up the sides of the pouch.  The leather strap also has a tangled length of tan colored suede type leather wrapped around it.  The rest of the item is dark brown.",location is noted as Philippines?
